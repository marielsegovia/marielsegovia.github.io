My decision to start at Flatiron and learn how to code and become a programmer wasn't really an easy one. Now that I look back, I think things in my life had already begun to change but I didn't really realize how much they were changing and how unhappy I was until my accident. I fell while hiking and ended up having a broken collarbone and a pretty severe concussion. I think that the concussion was definitely the most debilitating(I had headaches, eye sensitivity, dizziness, insomnia, etc). All of these things just came together all at once and because I literally couldn't do anything, I spent a lot of time sitting and thinking. At one point, I just knew that I wasn't happy with where my life was going and what I was doing. 

There were a lot of challenges that I had to overcome but I didn't want to stop learning. I didn't want my situation to determine my future. So I started looking into code. It had piqued my interest before and now it was something that I could do at home with very minimal movement, which I really needed to minimize, so it was also very convenient at the time. I started learning more and more and soon enough, I realized that it was something that I really wanted to continue learning. It was something that I realized I had a passion for. This was something that I really wanted to commit to. It was and continues to be something interesting and fascinating to me. There are so many different things you can improve, create, and do. The possibilities and applications are endless.

While this wasn't the traditional path that I had thought I would always take, it's the path that I want to take now. It's a choice that I've made and I chose Flatiron because of the opportunity for learning, personal and professional development, and because I could see that the people at Flatiron really care. I wanted to have the opportunity to learn at a place that would give me all the tools necessary to succeed but also help me succeed with the curriculum and with my career. I spent a lot of time healing and thinking about choosing Flatiron and choosing to become a programmer. I have made a lot of choices, some that I wasn't really sure of, but now that I'm doing it, I'm reaffirmed that choosing to do this was one of the best choices I have made.
