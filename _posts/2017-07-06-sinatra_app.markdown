Coming into this project, I was a lot more confident than I had been with my CLI app. My planning process was definitely different for this one. With my CLI application, I kind of just dived in head first to coding and building without planning much or making notes or reviewing my code to make sure it was the best code that I could write. This time, I decided to revert back to advice a professor of mine I once had given me. He said that before coding anything on the computer, we should write it down on paper first. It helped me sooo much to see everything on paper and actually write it out instead of just type it. (Plus, I was reading that during interviews for jobs, they'll sometimes give you a white board or paper to write out the answer to the problem/question they give you so I think continuing this practice will be beneficial.)

**The Process**

I started off with making a checklist of all of the instructions/requirements that this assessment requires. I'm definitely a planner so I make lists all the time and this was no exception. I did take a look at the example assessment and cloned it to see what it was about at first. After this was done, I had a messy brainstorming session with ideas for my app that had join tables, controllers, models, and anything else I could think of for that particular idea on the spot. Once I had a few good ideas, I wrote them onto a page in a much neater way and from there, I picked the topic I liked the most. From there, I wrote everything out from scratch and writing the migrations, models, controllers, and views I would need. Then I actually wrote out allll of the code. After that, I included some notes/suggestions for myself for later. 

I encountered my first error VERY early in the building process. It took my two days to figure out how to fix it. I of course added the spec.md file and then created the gemfile, rakefile, config file, and environment file in the config folder. I would run bundle install and it seemed to be working great. All of the gems and dependencies would be installed but when I tried running any rake tasks, it would break. I couldn't figure out what was wrong since all my code looked right to me so I googled and googled and looked at the example sinatra applications given on the learn assignment page and then continued to google. (2 days in and this is what the window for my sinatra project looked like: ![](http://i.imgur.com/u1z9Ukih.png))

I tried updating the bundle, installing the specific gem that I thought wasn't installing properly, I tried running bundle exec to see if that would work, I googled how to start a Sinatra app from scratch to see if I had done anything wrong, I even tried YouTube. After toying around with the code some more and taking out the parts that were giving me the error, two days later after I had started my project, I found the solution! I originally thought that my problem was with my bundle and Bundler.require but the problem was actually with my rakefile and environment file not connecting. 

**DEBUGGING TWO WEEK UPDATE**

*the tabs have increased!!!*

It has taken me two weeks to debug and make sure that everything works. I didn't work on it every day during those two weeks because I had work and other important things to deal with these past two weeks but I worked on it here and there, and let me just say, I had so much anxiety and frustration with this project during those two weeks. I had problems with the Rakefile, with the database and the schema, with my environment.rb file. I thought adding a database.yml file would help. I'm not sure if it did but after doing some research and making sure my database was connected and working properly to the rest of my files, things seemed to run a lot smoother. I was having trouble because when I was setting up the schema.rb file, it would create a development.sqlite file when my program needed a development.sqlite3 file. It seemed to make all the difference.

I had problems with user verification and with displaying the book title and book author after it's creation AND editing the book title and author and displaying it after editing. (*Ruby on Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl* was, in my opinion, one of the best things I could find.)The biggest bump in the road I had with this project was the editing part. This was the section I took majority of the two weeks on. I couldn't figure out how to make it let me edit my book submission. In the end, it was my route that was faltering me. But it was such a small thing that I couldn't find for the longest time! For some moments I thought it was my tables and my database so I redid the table migrations. I went through every single file I thought I would need to redo or debug and I tried rewriting my code in my views a different way and I became increasingly frustrated and frustrated when things. The problem was in my controller though so I wasn't looking for the problem in the right place to begin with! 

My application doesn't look as pretty or colorful as it could be which *slightly* bothers me but it works so it's ok for now. Perhaps later when I have more time, I can add some styling to make it look as pretty as can be.

I think that after this project, it has become even clearer to me that mindset is very important when approaching bugs and projects in general. I started off pretty well and pretty excited for this but bugs, added to problems and everyday bumps in the road with life were kind of just building and adding to my frustration and stress. Reflecting and looking back on this made me see that I didn't really start to efficiently look for the problem and solution to this until I started to relax myself and my mind and take a breather.
