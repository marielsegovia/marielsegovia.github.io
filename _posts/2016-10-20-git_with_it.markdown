I guess I was having an off day when I was first reading the lesson for Git and Git Remotes because I couldn't get the commands to work. I figured out how to directly edit files on GitHub but I couldn't figure out how to add files to my respository or push and pull them. I decided to give it a break and came back to it the next day which is what I usually do when I'm encountering a block to have a fresh mindset. It wasn't until I got to the Collaboration section that I really started to be able to create a pull request or merge or update branches. I'm 90% sure I just wasn't typing commands in right, which should tell you how out of it and tired I was since most commands are really short.

I had heard about Git & GitHub a few years back but I had never actually looked at it or done anything with it. I just have to say, I'm a very visual person and I learn best with diagrams and pictures and such so to me the most helpful thing when learning how to merge files and how to move between files was the timeline/diagram with the numbers and branches. The timeline reaffirmed my idea of how merging, adding, and moving between files was similar to how you could choose different paths on a road. 

I equated it with driving, your final destination being work, from your home on a certain day. Let's say you ran late but you know you have to eat breakfast and exercise in the morning. You end up having to pick up breakfast on your way(first bug). You go to wherever it is you're going for breakfast, order your food, and then once they're done, you realize they got the order wrong and gave you scrambled eggs instead of making them sunnyside up. So now you have to ask them to redo it(fixing another bug in your code). After it's fixed, you're on your way again. Now you're headed to the gym(another branch) and then work after. Maybe my example is a bit convoluted or hard to follow but I think it makes sense. Using git/github is basically about following certain paths and figuring out where you are in relation to the main path so you can do different things with those paths and know what commands to use to get to where you want to go.

I'm still fairly new in the Learn community so I'm still putting my toes in the water but I'm looking forward to learning more and using GitHub more and more to practice with these commands!
