Before starting at Flatiron, I had already had a good understanding of variables, booleans, conditionals, and loops(in a different language, C++). I had also learned about arrays but for some reason, it was something I had really struggled with so when I saw that that was included in the Procedural Ruby section, I was dreading it. I struggled the most with figuring out the Prime Lab, a small part of the Oxford Comma Lab and figuring out how #each methods work and when to use them. 

I think the most challenging part of learning Procedural Ruby for me is that I have to take extra time to really visualize what is going on. I'm a very visual person so I have to go through and draw out the loops or steps and write exactly what is happening down at each step to make sure my code is working the way it's supposed to or that i'm understanding examples in lessons correctly. I have to write things down, draw myself little diagrams, and/or color code the steps or hints or tricks to get things to work. It takes me a lot longer to get through lessons than I imagine it would if I were to just read through but it helps to understand and really cement the information in my brain. 

To explain to someone what I learned in this section I would say...
- We start with variables, which are words that store/hold information (and in Ruby, a variable can change type). To create them, we use (**=**) - assignment operator
- Now that we have variables, we can create methods, which start with **def** and end with **end**, and define them with argument(s) and code that make them dynamic. Something that I would point out about methods is that there can be a difference between the return values of methods and what you puts/print to the screen, which is important when working with those return values later on.
We can use... 
- boolean operators(tell you if something comes out to be true or false)
- comparison operators(compares strings, integers, etc in value)
- if and elsif statements(gives code specific conditions on when to run)
- loops(go through same block of code with different arguments a number of times based on conditions that are specified)
- arrays(like a list or collection of information that we can manipulate through the use of different methods such as #pop, #push, and #reverse)
- and hashes(bigger, badder arrays)
in Procedural Ruby.

I think these are the biggest things that stuck with me from Procedural Ruby that I didn't already know beforehand:
1. .Each Methods -- used to iterate over an array(collection of information) one at a time (learning when and how to use #each methods took me a while to get the hang of)
2. Hashes -- kind of like a bunch of related information put together in an orderly manner, like a dictionary
3. Other Enumerators -- ways to find/verify things
* Boolean Enumerators -- #all, #none?, #include
* Search Enumerators -- #detect, #select
* .Sort method was my favorite one to use

It was definitely challenging at times but I think I have really gained a good understanding of Procedural Ruby so far(I still have to finish the last couple of sections!). My relationship with Ruby, and specifically arrays, is a lot more friendlier and definitely more exciting now that I know more of what I'm doing so I'm looking forward to seeing what comes next!
