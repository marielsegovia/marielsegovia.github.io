This month I had a lot of difficulty staying on top of my lessons. Before I started, I came up with a sort of tracker/checklist to keep on my whiteboard so I would have a constant reminder of what I needed to work on(ex: finish the Intro to Ruby Development lessons, finish the Responsive Layout section of HTML/CSS, etc). Reflecting on this month and seeing the amount of work I did shows me that I didn't really do much which really messed up the timeline/checklist I had for my lessons.

I traveled a lot this month so in part, I didn't really have time to do much because I was so busy and out so much of the time. My biggest trip was to Seattle. (I loved it so much that I'm considering it as a potential place to move for work!) But after I came back, I had a huge case of wanderlust, and i'll admit that I tend to get ahead of myself ,so I started spending time researching places to live, work, eat, etc., in Seattle, so I wasn't really focused at the beginning of the month. The first month I started the web developer program, I was extremely focused and I was moving at a pretty fast pace. This second month, was a lot harder just because I had so many other things going on. I wasn't really aware that the days were going by so fast! Before I knew it, it was Thanksgiving and I had family obligations to tend to. I did do some work here and there but it wasn't at the pace that I had told myself and planned to be going at. 

I'm good at keeping myself motivated but this month was filled with traveling and family things so I didn't have a lot of time to do what I needed to do. I am starting to wonder if joining the weekly standup meetings or the accountability group will be a good thing to join this month and in the future to help keep myself accountable or when I feel that I haven't done much. One thing I know for sure is that this coming month, I have a lot of learning ( pun not intended ) to do.
